# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

# 7.6.0 (2023-10-15)
  * Improvement: across the board optimizations to adapt to the myQ server side shifting to a more pedantic approach to API access. Huge thanks to @jarz for the continued collaboration.

# 7.5.2 (2023-10-12)
  * Fix: myQ has begun adapting their OAuth flow and tightening up some tidbits. We adapt. Hat tip to @drysart and @justinlindh for the legwork on this one.

# 7.5.1 (2023-09-17)
  * Housekeeping.

# 7.5.0 (2023-09-15)
  * Improvement: API resiliency has been substantively improved through incorporating automatic retries across myQ regions. This should improve robustness across the occasional cloud infrastructure challenges that the myQ API encounters.
  * New feature: added a `login()` function. This is now a required first step prior to using the API for any other calls. The constructor no longer requires login credentials. See the README for details.
  * Housekeeping.
